# US Sale by PowerBI
I'm excited to share my latest Power BI project: a dashboard designed to visualize and explore US sales data. I wanted to create a clear and intuitive way to understand key trends and patterns in the data, and this dashboard does just that.
Dashboard Design Choices

__ Top-Level Overview: __I placed the most important metrics (Sales, Quantity, Profit, Discount) at the top using card visuals for quick reference. I wanted these to be the first things the viewer sees.
## Category Breakdown: I used a bar chart to showcase sales by product category. This allows for easy comparison and identification of top-performing categories.
## Geographic Focus: To highlight sales distribution, I used a tree map to visualize sales by city. This makes it simple to spot the major sales hubs.
## Customer Segmentation: I included a bar chart for sales by customer segment, as understanding which segments contribute most is crucial for targeted marketing.
## Deeper Dive: Recognizing that viewers might want to delve into specific details, I included slicers for Region, State, and City, enabling interactive filtering of the data.
## Sub-Category Exploration: To provide an even more granular view, I added a bar chart showcasing sales by sub-category, allowing for a deeper understanding of product performance.
Design Considerations

## Clarity: I aimed for a clean and uncluttered layout, using a simple colour palette and clear labels.
## Interactivity: The inclusion of slicers adds a dynamic element, encouraging viewers to explore the data themselves.
## Insight: I wanted to go beyond just displaying numbers. The visualizations are designed to reveal trends and comparisons, such as the relative performance of different product categories or regions.
Next Steps

While I'm happy with the current state of the dashboard, there are always areas for improvement. I'm considering adding:

### Data Labels: These would enhance the readability of the bar charts, making it easier to see exact values.
### Tooltips: Adding tooltips would allow viewers to access more detailed information on hover.
### Date Range Filter: This would provide the flexibility to analyze sales performance over specific periods.
